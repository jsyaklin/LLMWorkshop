BiographyHong Yang is the Richard C. Alkire Professor of Chemical Engineering. Dr. Yang is recognized for his work in nanotechnology, especially nanomaterials of well-defined structure and composition. He is particularly interested in the design and synthesis of bi- and multi-metallic nanostructures, which are evaluated for a range of catalytic applications, including fuel cell and water splitting. An elected Fellow of the American Association for the Advancement of Science and recipient of NSF CAREER Award, Dr. Yang is a section editor on Nanotechnology for the Current Opinion in Chemical Engineering and he serves on the editorial board of Nano Today and other journals. He joined the department in 2012. Dr. Yang received his BS from Tsinghua University, his MS from the University of Victoria and PhD from the University of Toronto. His postdoctoral work was at Harvard University. Prior to joining the Illinois faculty, he was a faculty member at the University of Rochester.
