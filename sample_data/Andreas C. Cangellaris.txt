Teaching StatementMy teaching interests and activities include: a) undergraduate courses in engineering electromagnetics; b) graduate-level courses in electromagnetic wave theory and its application to high-frequency electromagnetic device analysis and design; c) application of electromagnetic fields and waves concepts to the interpretation and quantification of noise generation, coupling and emissions in packaged electronic systems, with particular emphasis on the electromagnetic modeling of the signal and power distribution network of high-speed/high-frequency electronics; d) computational methodologies for electromagnetic field modeling, wave simulation and electromagnetic computer aided design; e) methodologies and algorithms for coupled, multi-physics modeling with applications to MEMS analysis and design.
Research StatementProfessor Cangellaris' research interests are in the area of theoretical and applied electromagnetism with special focus on the advancement of modeling methodologies and the development of computer-aided design tools in support of performance analysis and noise-aware design of high-frequency/high-speed integrated electronic components, circuits and systems. In parallel, his research group is pursuing the development of both physics-based and mathematical model order reduction methodologies for reducing the complexity of discrete electromagnetic and hybrid electromagnetic-circuit models of the interconnect and power distribution network in packaged electronic systems. A recent focus of this modeling and reduced-order modeling effort is in the advancement of comprehensive, physics-based models and reduced-order, accurate macromodels of MEMS devices.
Undergraduate Research OpportunitiesCurrent undergraduate research opportunities in our group involve: a) application of circuit and electromagnetic theory concepts to the understanding and quantitative assessment of electromagnetic interference effects in high-speed electronic systems and their impact on system signal integrity; b) behavioral modeling of MEMS devices.
