Teaching StatementI love to teach and learn. My mission is to show my students the boundary of textbook knowledge. I want to help teach students to be great designers, confident in building, skilled in making tradeoffs, and visionary in their engineering solutions. I want them to succeed by helping them develop skills to model, analyze, design, synthesize, build, test, and debug. I draw from my academic, research, and industry experiences to embolden students to learn and build connections to real-world engineering systems where observations often do not equal “classroom” expectations.
Research StatementConverting electricity to and from mechanical motion is a foundation of modern civilization. Electromechanical systems consume about 45% of global power and are evolving rapidly. Emerging applications in robotic actuators, renewable energy harvesters, and electrification of ships, aircraft, cars, and bicycles pose new challenges in making electromechanical systems power-dense and efficient over a wide range of loading and speed patterns. Conventional approaches to using machines intended for operating loads of the 20th century can only result in a bottleneck in our future energy development. There are unlimited intellectual opportunities for leveraging the flexibility that electromechanics, power electronics with new semiconductor device technology, and control have to offer to develop system-specific sustainable solutions. Approaching energy conversion with the simultaneous perspective of electromechanics, power electronics, and control carves new avenues through the challenges of difficult applications to push the trade-off boundaries for systems to be physically small, efficient, reliable, flexible, inexpensive, electric-grid friendly, and environmentally sound. My research mission is to create new paradigms in electromechanical energy conversion systems while working at the combined domains of electromechanics, power electronics, and control.
Graduate Research OpportunitiesI am looking for students passionate about electrical machines, power electronics, control of power-electronic-based drives, and robotic actuators. Please apply through the department. Students with a mechanical engineering degree are also strongly encouraged to apply.
