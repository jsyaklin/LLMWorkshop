BiographyArne W. Fliflet received the B.Sc. degree from Duke University, Durham, NC, in 1970, and the Ph.D. degree from the University of Virginia, Charlotte, VA, in 1975, both in physics. His dissertation was on the application of many body perturbation theory to atomic photoionization. As a Research Fellow at Caltech from 1975 to 1979, he developed theoretical approaches to low-energy electron-molecule scattering.  In 1979 he joined a small consulting firm, B-K Dynamics, Inc., in Rockville, MD. At B-K Dynamics, he was involved with some of the first gyrotron research conducted in the United States, including the development of theoretical models and computer codes used in gyrotron design. In 1982, he joined the Naval Research Laboratory (NRL) as a Research Physicist in the Plasma Physics Division. At NRL he conducted theoretical and experimental research on gyrotrons, related high power coherent millimeter-wave radiation sources, and gyrotron applications. For many years he served as the head of the Particle and Radiation Beam Generation Section. His areas of research included: gyrotrons for tokamak plasma heating, relativistic gyrotrons, cyclotron auto-resonance masers, quasi-optical gyrotrons, magnicons, near-terahertz, higher-harmonic gyrotrons, microwave processing of materials, and millimeter-wave cloud radars.  In 2014 he joined the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign where he serves as a Lecturer. He has authored or coauthored over 100 papers and holds seven patents. Dr. Fliflet is a Fellow of the American Physical Society and a Senior Member and Life Member of IEEE.
