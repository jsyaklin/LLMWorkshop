BiographyXiming Cai has been on the CEE at Illinois faculty since 2002, where he teaches undergraduate and graduate courses in water resources engineering, surface water hydrology and application of geographic information systems, and river basin management. He holds a B.S. in Water Resources Engineering (1990) and an M.S. in Hydrology and Water Resources (1994) from Tsinghua University, China, and a Ph.D. in Environmental and Water Resources Engineering (1999) from the University of Texas at Austin.Ximing Cai’s primary research area is water resources systems analysis, with a focus on coupled hydrology-human systems. He has been developing and applying systems approaches and data-driven methods to various water resources management problems, including food-energy-water nexus, river basin management, reservoir operation, drought management, and interdependent infrastructure system planning. His work emphasizes interdisciplinary research by connecting hydrology and economics for understanding environmental and water resources systems complexity and developing  water management policies and solutions. He was elected to 2019 AGU fellow for forging a new science of hydrologic change accounting for human interaction and using it to advance water resources management.  He is the recipient of 2023 Julian Hinds Award from Am. Soc. of Civil Engineers (ASCE) and the 2024 Warren Hall Medal from University Council of Water Resources (UCOWR), which highlights contribution to interdisciplinary research in water resources. He currently serves as an executive member of Working Group for Circular Bioeconomy Initiative, American Society of Agricultural and Biological Engineers (ASABE) and Chair of Task Force Committee on Downscaling SDGs to National, Basin and Local Scales, with Int’l Water Resources Association (IWRA).
