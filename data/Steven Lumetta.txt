Education
Ph.D., Computer Science, University of California at Berkeley, December 1998

Post-Doctoral Research OpportunitiesIf the MRI is funded, there are three positions for people to develop the instrument, and I intend to find postdocs to fill those positions.   The intent is to use the MRI as a catalyst for interdisciplinary research efforts around computational genomics, so these postdocs will be able to help with those efforts and participate in them part time (% for some of the positions ramps down later in the project based on assumption of moving part of their time over to research efforts).
Research Interests
computational genomics, smartphone-based bioassays, optical network architecture, computer architecture, cluster computing, parallel computing, user-level communication, validation and reliability


Research Areas
Architecture, Compilers, and Parallel Computing
Software systems
Systems and Networking
