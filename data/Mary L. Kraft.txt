BiographyMary L. Kraft is Professor and Robert W. Schaefer Scholar in Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering. She also is an affiliate professor in the Department of Chemistry. Her research group is developing new bioimaging approaches for individual cells to understand and predict biological function. They use these techniques for applied research, such as detecting stem cell differentiation for tissue engineering, and for basic research on the roles of plasma membrane organization in influenza virus replication and other important biological processes. Professor Kraft joined the department in 2007 after working as a postdoctoral fellow at Stanford University. She received her BS degree from the University of Illinois at Chicago and her PhD degree in Chemistry from the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign in 2003.
