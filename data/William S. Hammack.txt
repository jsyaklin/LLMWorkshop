BiographyBill Hammack is a Professor of Chemical & Biomolecular Engineering at the University of Illinois, where he has pioneered new and novel approaches to engineering outreach. He is the creator and host of the popular YouTube channel engineerguyvideo. From 1999 to 2006 he created a groundbreaking series of over 200 pieces for public radio that described what engineers do, why they do it and how. His outreach work has been recognized by The National Association of Science Writer’s Science in Society Award; the American Chemical Society’s Grady-Stack Medal, and the American Institute of Physics’ Science Writing Award. His books include Michael Faraday’s The Chemical History of a Candle with Lectures, Teaching Guides and Student Activities (2016), Why Engineers Need to Grow a Long Tail (2011), How Engineers Create the World (2012), Eight Amazing Engineering Stories (2012), and Albert Michelson’s Harmonic Analyzer (2014).
