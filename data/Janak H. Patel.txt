Education
PhD - Electrical Engineering, Stanford University   1976
MS - Electrical Engineering, Stanford University   1971
B. Tech - Electrical Engineering, Indian Institute of Technology, Madras, India   1970
BS - Physics, Gujarat University, India  1967

BiographyPatel’s research contributions include Pipeline Scheduling, Cache Coherence, Cache Simulation, Cache Data Prefetch, Multiprocessor memory modeling and analysis, Interconnection Networks, On-line Error Detection, Reliability analysis of memories with ECC and Scrubbing, Design for Testability, Built-In Self-Test, Fault Simulation and Automatic Test Generation.  Patel is the inventor of the well known Illinois Cache Coherence Protocol and Illinois Scan Architecture, both are used heavily in most modern microprocessors.  In addition, his Stride Prediction based Data Prefetch is the basis for nearly all data prefetch techniques used in most current microprocessors.  Patel has supervised over 85 M.S. and Ph.D. theses and published over 200 technical papers. During his academic stay at Illinois, Patel has had a major role in two start-ups. First was as founding technical advisor to Nexgen Microsystems, which gave rise to AMD’s present line of microprocessors. Second was as a co-founder of Sunrise Test Systems, which now is the basis for many test tools from Synopsys.  In addition, Patel has provided technical consulting to a wide range of industries on architecture, reliability and testing.He received a Bachelor of Science degree in Physics from Gujarat University, India and Bachelor of Technology in Electrical Engineering from the Indian Institute of Technology, Madras, India, and a Master of Science and Ph.D. in Electrical Engineering from Stanford University. He is a Fellow of ACM and IEEE, a recipient of the 1998 IEEE Piore Award and IEEE Test Technology Council Lifetime Achievement Award.

Professional Highlights
"Critical Operation Point" Hypothesis proposed in 2007, is making waves in the community of researchers trying to mitigate the effects of CMOS Process variations with error detection and correction methods. This work has been presented as a Distinguished Lecture at numerous Universities.
"Illinois Scan Architecture" that I had proposed in 1998 has now been used in many modern chips from Intel, IBM and many others. It has also been incorporated in CAD tools from Cadence, Synopsis, Syntest and Magma Design.
I first proposed in 1994 a method of non-sequential Data Pre-Fetch in general purpose microprocessors. In few years it became the basis of all Data Pre-Fetch techniques in all modern microprocessors.
"Illinois Cache Coherence Protocol" that I had put forward in 1984 is now the basis of most multi-core microprocessors cache protocols.
