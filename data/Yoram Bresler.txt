BiographyYoram Bresler received the B.Sc.  (cum laude) and M.Sc. degrees from the Technion, Israel Institute of Technology, in 1974 and 1981 respectively, and the Ph.D degree from Stanford University, in 1986, all in Electrical Engineering.  In 1987 he joined the  University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, where he is  currently a GEBI Founder Professor of Engineering at the Departments of Electrical and Computer Engineering and of Bioengineering, and professor at the Coordinated Science Laboratory.   He is also President and Chief Technology Oﬃcer at InstaRecon, Inc., a startup he founded to commercialize breakthrough technology for tomographic reconstruction developed in his academic research.  His current  research interests include multi-dimensional and statistical signal processing and their applications to inverse problems in imaging, and in particular compressed sensing and computed tomography, and machine learning in signal processing. 
 Dr. Bresler has served on the editorial board of several journals, including the IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing, the IEEE Journal on Selected Topics in Signal Processing, Machine Vision and Applications, and the SIAM Journal on Imaging Science. He has also served on various committees of the IEEE, including the Image and Multidimensional Signal Processing Technical Committee, Biomaging and Signal Processing Technical Committee, and the Awards Board of the IEEE Signal Processing Society.  
 Dr. Bresler  received two Best Journal Paper Awards from the IEEE Signal Processing society, and two paper he coauthored with his students received the Young Author Best Paper Award from the same society in 2002 and in 2016.  He is the recipient of a 1991 NSF Presidential Young Investigator  Award, the Technion (Israel Inst. of Technology) Fellowship in 1995, and the Xerox Senior Award for Faculty Research in 1998. He was named a University of Illinois Scholar in 1999, appointed as an Associate at the Center for Advanced Study of the University in 2001-2, and Faculty Fellow at the National Cener for Supercomputing Applications (NCSA) in 2006. He is a Fellow of the IEEE and of the American Institute for Medical and Biomedical Engineers (AIMBE).

Professional Highlights
My work with my students and colleagues on bilinear inverse problems has produced the first results on precise and optimal conditions for unique and stable signal recovery in these problems, as well as the first computationally efficient algorithm with optimal scaling of the required data and theoretically guaranteed performance. Bilinear inverse problems arise in many areas of science and engineering, with well-known examples being blind signal processing problems, such as blind deconvolution and blind gain and phase calibration. These have applications in imaging, sensor array processing, radar imaging, machine vision, etc.
My work with my students on machine learning techniques in signal and image processing, entitled "Transform Learning," has resulted in significant improvement to compressed sensing techniques for imaging and provided a new method for effective signal modeling
My work on fast algorithms for tomographic reconstruction solved a problem that was open for 30 years since the invention of computed tomography, and enables, for the first time, effective algorithmic acceleration for practically all tomographic imaging geometries. These inventions are being commercialized by a startup company that I founded, and have resulted thus far in the world's fastest reconstruction software for micro-CT reconstruction, which provides speedups up to 150 fold, and is included in a commercial line of micro-CT scanners.
My work in the 1990's has pioneered the idea, techniques, and algorithms for the field now known as Compressed Sensing, which has become in the past 10 years the hottest area in signal processing.

Teaching StatementMy teaching focuses on signal processing at both the undergraduate and graduate level. I regularly teach ECE310 -- introduction to DSP, ECE311 - Intro to DSP Lab,  and ECE 513 -- Vector Space Signal Processing.
Research Statement
My current research addresses three main areas:
1)  Statistical and Machine Learning (including deep neural networks) for inverse problems in imaging.
2) New imaging techniques in bio-medical ultrasound combing physics and advanced signal processing techniques 
3) Study of fundamental performance bounds and the development of computationally efficient algorithms with provable guaranteed performance for inverse problems  arising in imaging
