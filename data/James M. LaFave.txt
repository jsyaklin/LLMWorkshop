BiographyJames M. LaFave holds a B.S. (1986) and M.S. (1987) in Civil Engineering from the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign (UIUC), and a Ph.D. (1997) in Civil (Structural) Engineering from the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor. He has been on the faculty of the Department of Civil & Environmental Engineering (CEE) at Illinois since 1999, and was Chair of the Illinois CEE Structures Group from 2010-14. Professor LaFave also served as Associate Head & Director of Undergraduate Studies in CEE at Illinois from 2016-20, as Director of CEE Education Programs for the Zhejiang University - UIUC Joint Institute (ZJUI) from 2018-20, and as Associate Dean for Facilities & Capital Planning in the UIUC Grainger College of Engineering from 2020-21. He is currently Co-Chair of the Illinois CEE Structures Group (since 2023).
Dr. LaFave was a faculty member at the University of Massachusetts-Amherst for two years before coming to Illinois, was a visiting professor at the University of Washington in Seattle during the 2007-08 academic year, and was a NIST Associate at the National Institute of Standards and Technology in 2015. He is a licensed Professional Engineer with over four years of consulting engineering experience at Wiss, Janney, Elstner Associates, Inc. in Princeton, NJ, and Sargent & Lundy Engineers in Chicago. Professor LaFave teaches undergraduate and graduate courses in the area of structural design, including courses on behavior, design, and assessment of reinforced concrete, structural steel, and prestressed concrete building, bridge, and ballpark structures. He also works with students in his capacity as Faculty Adviser to the Illinois CEE Steel Bridge Team.
Dr. LaFave is a member of the American Concrete Institute (ACI) and the Earthquake Engineering Research Institute. He was Chair of Joint ACI-ASCE Committee 352 ("Joints and Connections in Monolithic Concrete Structures") from 2002-09, is past-Chair of two other ACI subcommittees, and has served as a voting member on three other ACI committees (including ACI 318 "Structural Concrete Building Code" Subcommittee J ("Joints and Connections")). He is a Founding Editor-in-Chief for the Journal of Building Engineering and has previously served on the Editorial Board of the journal Engineering Structures.
In 2002 and 2005, Professor LaFave received the Illinois ASCE Student Chapter Outstanding Instructor Award, and he was named a 2005 Illinois College of Engineering Xerox Award recipient for Faculty Research. In 2006, he was presented with the ASTM Alan H. Yorkdale Memorial Award by the American Society for Testing & Materials, and in 2007 he received an Outstanding TMS Journal Paper Award from The Masonry Society. Dr. LaFave was elected as a Fellow of ACI in 2008 and received the ACI Wason Medal for Most Meritorious Paper in 2009. He was presented with the Outstanding 2016 Paper Award in the ASCE Journal of Performance of Constructed Facilities by the American Society of Civil Engineers (ASCE) Forensic Engineering Division, and he received the 2023 Martin P. Korn Award from the Precast/Prestressed Concrete Institute (PCI).
