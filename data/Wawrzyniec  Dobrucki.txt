Graduate Research OpportunitiesWe accept graduate student applications through the Department of Bioengineering and the Medical Scientist Training (MST) Program.  We look for students with genuine interests in molecular multimodal imaging (PET-CT, SPECT-CT, PET-optical, etc.), targeted probe development and application of novel imaging strategies to monitor disease progression and efficacy of therapeutic interventions in both cardiology and oncology.
Undergraduate Research OpportunitiesWe consider undergraduate students from all departments at the University of Illinois. Students will be involved in a research project under the guidance of graduate student. Undergraduates will typically volunteer or work for credit, however exceptional students will have the opportunity to apply for the undergraduate fellowships in the laboratory.
Research Interests
Development of integrated quantitative imaging approaches to monitor individualized programs for disease prevention
In vivo mapping of biological processes using PET/SPECT/CT molecular imaging with targeted imaging agents
PET, SPECT, X-ray CT, molecular imaging, image analysis, multimodal imaging probes
The combination of different imaging modalities and technologies for mapping biomolecular and biological processes
within single cell or whole organs has an extraordinary potential for revolutionizing the diagnosis and
treatment of pathophysiological disorders, and thus for mitigating the significant social and economic costs associated
with the clinical management of diseases. The focus of Dr. Dobrucki’s research is to develop such integrated
imaging approaches to noninvasively monitor and track physiologic processes including cancer progression, peripheral
and myocardial angiogenesis, and vascular remodeling using functional and anatomical imaging modalities
including SPECT/PET, optical imaging and X-ray CT, respectively. Such imaging strategies will eventually lead to
individualized programs for disease prevention through advanced diagnosis, risk stratification and targeted cell
therapies resulting in more successful and efficient health care.
