BiographyAl-Qadi holds the Grainger Distinguished Chair in Engineering and is the Director of the Illinois Center for Transportation (ICT) at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign (UIUC). Prior to his appointment at UIUC, he served as an instructor and research engineer at Penn State University from 1988 to 1990, and as a faculty member in the Charles E. Via Jr. Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering at Virginia Tech from 1990 to 2004. By 1998, he had been promoted to full professor and was subsequently named the Charles E. Via Jr. Professor. Al-Qadi earned his B.S. (1984) from Yarmouk University in Jordan, and his M.Eng. (1986) and Ph.D. (1990) degrees in civil engineering from Penn State University.At Virginia Tech, Al-Qadi established the roadway infrastructure group and designed various heavily instrumented pavement sections for the Smart Road, a state-of-the-art full-scale research facility that became one of North America’s leading transportation test environments. At UIUC, he founded and elevated ICT to international prominence and initiated the Illinois Autonomous and Connected Track (I-ACT), a proposed high-speed, multimodal test track in Rantoul, Illinois. Recently designed, I-ACT is set to become one of the world’s most advanced test tracks for electric and autonomous vehicles, freight, and energy harvesting technologies.Al-Qadi’s research and consulting focus on a range of transportation-related topics, including highway and airfield sustainability, rolling resistance, fuel consumption, resilience, pavement mechanics, advanced modeling, tire-pavement interaction, transportation modeling and testing, interface systems (including geosynthetics), asphalt mixes, pavement recycling optimization, ground-penetrating radar, infrastructure asset management, and autonomous vehicles. He also investigates energy harvesting, truck platoons, and the impact of electric trucks on infrastructure.A registered professional engineer, Al-Qadi is an elected Distinguished Member of the American Society of Civil Engineers (ASCE) and an honorary member of multiple organizations. He has served as an honorary professor at institutions including Southeast University, Chang'an University, and Tongji University in China, Aston University in the UK, KTH Royal Institute of Technology in Sweden, and Harbin Institute of Technology in China. He is the Editor-in-Chief of the International Journal of Pavement Engineering, and has held editorial positions with other journals.Al-Qadi has received numerous prestigious awards, including the National Science Foundation Young Investigator Award (1994), the Quadrennial International Geosynthetic Society Award (2002), ARTBA S.S. Steinberg Award (2013), and the ASCE James Laurie Prize (2007). More recently, he was honored with the 2024 Executive Officer Distinguished Leadership Award and the TRB Roy W. Crum Distinguished Service Award (2023). His achievements were also profiled in the November-December 2006 issue of TRNews. He has been recognized with several best paper awards and received honors for excellence in research and teaching. In 2024, he received the 2024 Executive Officer Distinguished Leadership Award, the University of Illinois 2024-25 President’s Executive Leadership Program Fellow, and the CUTC Life Achievement Award for Transportation Research and Education (2025).Al-Qadi is the past president of the ASCE Transportation and Development Institute and founder of the Academy of Pavement Science and Engineering. He has chaired/co-chaired more than 30 international conferences, including the 2006 International NDE Conference on Civil Engineering and multiple ASCE International Airfield and Highway Pavement Conferences. His service extends to leadership roles in technical committees and taskforces.A prolific scholar, Al-Qadi has authored over 1,000 publications, including more than 390 refereed journal papers and 160 refereed conference papers. He has served as the principal investigator for over 180 research projects, with sponsorship from various federal, state, and international agencies, as well as industry. His consulting work includes major projects with organizations such as the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA), BP Amoco, Michelin, and several others.
Research StatementAl-Qadi’s teaching, research, and consulting interests and expertise focus primarily on highway and airfield sustainability, rolling resistance and fuel consumption, resiliency, pavement mechanics, advanced modeling, tire-pavement interaction, transportation roadway modeling and testing, interface and interlayer systems (including geosynthetics), pavement materials, sustainability, and life-cycle assessment, asphalt mixes, recycled materials and performance prediction, modified asphalt binder rheology, pavement recycling optimization, ground-penetrating radar optimization and signal analysis, infrastructure asset management systems and pavement condition assessment, preservation technologies, transportation infrastructure instrumentation and full-scale accelerated testing; autonomous and conceded vehicles and trucks, energy harvesting, truck platoons and impact of electrical trucks on infrastructure, and forensic engineering and arbitration.
