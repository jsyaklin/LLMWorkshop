Research StatementMy research has focused on large scale simulation of charge transport phenomena in solid-state and soft-matter systems.  My group investigates the properties of ultra-scaled MOS devices, including size-quantization in nanoscale channels and thermal phenomena, particularly generation and transport of phonons.  Transport is studied with particle Monte Carlo models with corrections to account for size quantization. This work has led to the development of the Monte Carlo simulator MOCA 2D and MOCA 3D.  In the soft-matter area, we investigate transport of ions in nanoscale biological and biomimetic membranes, using similar engineering approaches based on Monte Carlo simulation where the water background is included implicitly.  Simulations work has focused on the study of biological ionic channels, with the development of the transport Monte Carlo code bioMOCA, a full 3-D self-consistent simulator.  More recently, I have become interested in scientific cyber-infrastructure and I have led the development of the nanoBIO node for the nanHUB portal of the NSF Network for Computational Nanotechnology.  Subsequently I have been involved with the Big Data to Knowledge (BD2K) NIH Center of Excellence "A Knowledge Engine for Genomics (KnowEnG)" at Illinois, leading the effort for cyber-infrastructure implementation on Amazon AWS cloud and for the development of automated online computational pipelines.
