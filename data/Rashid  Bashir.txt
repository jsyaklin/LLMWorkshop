BiographyRashid Bashir is Professor of Bioengineering, the Grainger Distinguished Chair in Engineering, and is currently the 15th Dean of Grainger College of Engineering at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. He received his B.S. degree in Electrical Engineering from Texas Tech University and his M.S and Ph.D. in Electrical Engineering from Purdue University in 1992. He spent 6 years at National Semiconductor Corporation rising to a Sr. Engineering Manager where he contributed to or led the development and commercialization of 4 generations of analog, high voltage, and RF microelectronics manufacturing technologies. He started his academic career at Purdue University where he spent 10 years. He held a Visiting Scientist position at Massachusetts General Hospital and Shriner’s Hospital for Children and was Visiting Professor of Surgery at Harvard Medical School, Cambridge, MA. He was the recipient of the Joel and Spira teaching Award at Purdue, the NSF Faculty Early Career Award. He joined University of Illinois at Urbana Champaign in 2007 as the Director of the Holonyak Micro and Nanotechnology Laboratory, a campus wide resource in clean room fabrication and bionanotechnology. In 2012, he became the head of the Department of Bioengineering. He was member of the core founding team for the Carle Illinois College of Medicine, the world’s first engineering-based College of Medicine at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign. He was co-chair of the curriculum development committee and also served as the Executive Associate Dean and chief diversity officer for the Carle Illinois College of Medicine. In 2018, he was appointed as the 15th dean of the College of Engineering (renamed to The Grainger College of Engineering in 2019). He is an internationally renowned scholar in micro-fluidics and nanotechnology based diagnostic technologies for precision and personalized medicine, and 3D bio-fabrication of multi-cellular engineered living systems for biological soft robotics.
