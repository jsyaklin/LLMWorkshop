BiographyBrighten Godfrey is a Professor in the Department of Computer Science at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. He co-founded and served as CTO of network verification pioneer Veriflow through its 2019 acquisition by VMware (now Broadcom), where he now serves as a Technical Director. He received his Ph.D. at UC Berkeley in 2009, and his B.S. at Carnegie Mellon University in 2002. His research interests lie in the design of networked systems and algorithms. He is a winner of the ACM SIGCOMM Rising Star Award, the UIUC Dean's Award for Excellence in Research, the Sloan Research Fellowship, an Internet2 Innovative Application Award, the National Science Foundation CAREER Award, and multiple best paper awards.  He was a Beckman Fellow at the UIUC Center for Advanced Study in 2014-2015, and has served as program committee co-chair of ACM SIGCOMM, ACM HotNets and the Symposium on SDN Research.  He is currently serving as a member of the ACM SIGCOMM Steering Committee.
