BiographyTamer Başar  has been  with the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign since 1981, where is currently  the Director of the Center for Advanced Study (appointed in 2014), and  holds the academic positions of Swanlund Endowed Chair; Center for Advanced Study Professor of Electrical and Computer Engineering; Professor, Coordinated Science Laboratory; Professor, Information Trust Institute; and Affiliate Professor, Mechanical Science and Engineering. In 2018, he served as Interim Dean of the College of Engineering, and between 2008 and 2010, he was the Interim Director of the Beckman Institute for Advanced Science and Technology. He received his BSEE degree (1969) from Robert College (Istanbul), and MS (1970), MPhil (1971), and PhD (1972) degrees from Yale University (New Haven).
Dr. Başar is a member of the US National Academy of Engineering (elected in 2000); Fellow of the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE), International Federation of Automatic Control (IFAC), and Society of Industrial and Applied Mathematics (SIAM); a past president of the IEEE Control Systems Society (CSS), the founding (and past) president of the International Society of Dynamic Games (ISDG), and a past president of the American Automatic Control Council (AACC). He has received several awards and recognitions over the years, including the highest awards of IEEE CSS, IFAC, AACC, and ISDG (respectively, the Bode Lecture Prize, Quazza Medal, Bellman Award, and Isaacs Award), the IEEE Control Systems Technical Field Award, Medal of Science of Turkey, and a number of international honorary doctorates and professorships, including chaired professorship at Tsinghua University. He has also received the Tau Beta Pi Daniel C. Drucker Eminent Faculty Award of the College of Engineering (2004).
Professor Başar has over 900 publications in systems, control, communications, optimization, networks, and dynamic games, including books on non-cooperative dynamic game theory, robust control, network security, wireless and communication networks, and stochastic networks. Among his current research interests are multi-agent networked systems; stochastic teams, games, and networks; security; reinforcement learning; energy systems, including the smart grid; social networks; and cyber-physical systems. He was the editor-in-chief of the premier journal in control, Automatica, for eleven years (2004-2014), and is currently editor of several book series.

Research StatementMy current research interests concern:o Formulation of security and trust in communication and computer networks within control- and game-theoretic frameworks, addressing issues like intrusion detection and response, malware filtering, trust propagation and evolution, and resource allocation.o Remote control over networks under rate constraints, where the underlying issues are quantization and handling of packet losses and the presence noise in forward and reverse channels.o Optimal control and sensing over networks when the number of transmissions is restricted a priori.o Pricing, optimum resource allocation, and  mechanism design in networks with multiple user and service classes.o Consensus in computation under bit constraints on exchange of information among different computing stations, and with asynchronous communication.o Control of packets in networks for improved performance and particularly with regard to TCP and router algorithms.o Multi-level multi-resolution games with a high population of agents operating in adversarial environments.o Application of game-theoretic tools to resilience of cyber-physical systems, and the smart grid.
