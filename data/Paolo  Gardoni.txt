BiographyProf. Paolo Gardoni is the Alfredo H. Ang Family Professor and an Excellence Faculty Scholar in the Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering in the Grainger College of Engineering at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign.  He is also a Professor in the Department of Industrial and Enterprise Systems Engineering in the Grainger College of Engineering, a Professor in the Department of Biomedical and Translational Sciences in the Carle Illinois College of Medicine, and a Fellow and Faculty Scholar of the Office of Risk Management & Insurance Research in the Gies College of Business.  Prof. Gardoni has several international courtesy appointments including at Loughborough University in the UK; the Indian Institute of Technology Guwahati (IITG) in India; and Tsinghua University, Tongji University, and Jianghan University in China. Prof. Gardoni is the Director of the MAE Center, which focuses on creating a Multi-hazard Approach to Engineering and started as an NSF Engineering Research Center.  He is the Editor-in-Chief of the international journal Reliability Engineering and System Safety (IF=9.4) published by Elsevier, and the founder and former Editor-in-Chief of the international journal Sustainable and Resilient Infrastructure published by Taylor and Francis Group.  He also serves on the Editorial Board of 9 other journals and as the Associate Editor of 5 journals.  Prof. Gardoni is a former member of the Board of Governors of the Engineering Mechanics Institute (EMI) of the American Society of Civil Engineering (ASCE) (2021-2024) and the Board of Directors of the International Civil Engineering Risk and Reliability Association (CERRA) (2015-2023); and the current member of the Advisory Council of the International Forum on Engineering Decision Making (IFED), the Probabilistic Methods Committee (PMC) of the EMI, and several national and international committees and associations that focus on risk, reliability, and resilience analysis. His research interests include reliability, risk, and life cycle analysis; probabilistic mechanics; sustainable and resilient infrastructure; decision-making under uncertainty; performance assessment of deteriorating systems; modeling of natural hazards and societal impact; ethical, social, and legal dimensions of risk; optimal strategies for natural hazard mitigation and disaster recovery; impacts of climate change; and engineering ethics.
