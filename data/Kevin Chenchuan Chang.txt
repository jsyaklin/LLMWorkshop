BiographyKevin Chen-Chuan Chang is a Professor in Computer Science, University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. He received a BS from National Taiwan University and PhD from Stanford University in Electrical Engineering. His research addresses large-scale information access and knowledge acquisition, for search, mining, and integration across structured and unstructured big data, with current focuses on Web search/mining and social media analytics. He received ICDE 10-Year Test of Time Award in 2022 and Best Paper Selection/Awards in VLDB 2000 and 2013 and ASONAM 2019, NSF CAREER Award in 2002, NCSA Faculty Fellow Award in 2003, IBM Faculty Awards in 2004 and 2005, Academy for Entrepreneurial Leadership Faculty Fellow Award in 2008, and the Incomplete List of Excellent Teachers at University of Illinois in 2001, 2004, 2005, 2006, 2010, 2011, 2019, 2022, 2023. He is passionate to bring research results to the real world and, with his students, co-founded Cazoodle, a startup from the University of Illinois, and developed GrantForward.com funding discovery and dissemination service, a vertical search engine integrating 20,000 sources, subscribed by 200+ institutions including Harvard, Stanford, Yale, Cornell University, University of California, CMU, Mayo Clinic, and National Institutes of Health.

Research StatementI lead the FORWARD Data Lab group, which is part of the larger Data and Information Systems Laboratories, at the CS department of UIUC. Our research overall aims at bridging structured and unstructured data— to bring structured/semantic-rich access to the myriad and massive unstructured data which accounts for most of the world’s information. Therefore, our research spans natural language processing, data mining, data management/databases, information retrieval, and machine learning. As our objectives, we aim at developing novel systems, principled algorithms, and formal theories that ultimately deliver real-world applications. As our approaches, we seek to be inspired by and learn from the data we are tackling-- i.e., we believe the key to tame big data is to learn the wisdom hidden in the large scale of the data.
Research Interests
Natural language processing, data mining, data management, and information retrieval with machine learning techniques, with emphasis on the application areas of Web and social media-based knowledge acquisition and organization across structured and unstructured data.
