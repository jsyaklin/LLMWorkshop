Research StatementOscar Lopez-Pamies is interested in the mechanics and physics of heterogeneous materials with a particular emphasis on soft-matter systems. He focuses on the development of mathematical theories to describe, explain, and predict the macroscopic behavior, stability, and failure of these materials directly in terms of their microscopic behavior. Specific areas of interest include the mathematical modeling of the mechanical, the electromechanical, and the magnetomechanical response and failure ― by geometric instabilities and fracture ― of unfilled elastomers, filled elastomers, foams, and block copolymers. Other areas of recent focus include the development of numerical methods for nonlinear (elliptic, Hamilton-Jacobi, and hyperbolic) partial differential equations.
