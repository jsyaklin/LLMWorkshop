Research StatementMy research is in the areas of systems biology and computational genomics. Our group conducts research in three principal areas: complex neurological diseases, metabolic networks in bacterial pathogens and microbiome, evolution of gene networks in model organisms. Questions of interest include studying how diseases and pathogens may have created molecular novelties operant in the constituent pathways, and what mechanisms are at play in generating these novelties, which could then be studied for their potential as drug-targets. We use computational genomics, bioinformatics, and systems biology approaches which include gene network analysis, '-omics' database and network mining, comparative genomics, and metabolic modeling. The latter approach is used in context of identifying changes in metabolic networks in microbial pathogens or environmental metagenomic samples, which arise as a result of variations in their environmental niches.
