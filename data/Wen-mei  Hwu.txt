Course Development
ECE 508, "Parallel Algorithm Techniques." Algorithm techniques for enhancing the scalability of parallel software:  scatter vs. gather, problem decomposition, spatial sorting and binning, privatization for reduced conflicts, tiling for data locality, regularization for improved load balance, compaction to conserve memory bandwidth, double-buffering to overlap latencies, and data layout for improved efficiency of DRAM accesses. These techniques address the most challenging problems in building scalable parallel software. (For Fall 2014).
Coursera Online course, "Heterogeneous Parallel Programming." Developed and created for an initial offering in 2012.  This course teaches the use of CUDA/OpenCL, OpenACC, and MPI for programming heterogeneous parallel computing systems based on GPUs. It is application oriented and only introduces necessary technological knowledge to solidify understanding. The 2012 offering drew more than 26,000 students registered, 9,900 students participated in the programming lab, 461 students earned certificate of achievement, and 2,142 students earned certificate of distinction. Hwu and his Ph.D. student Abdul Dakkak developed a scalable, web-based GPU programming environment using the Amazon GPU Cloud to enable students from all-over the world to do hands-on GPU programming exercises with their laptops, tablets, and even mobile phones. Subsequent offerings of this course in 2013 and 2014 resulted in similar numbers and further built up a team of 300 volunteer teaching assistants who cover the class forum in all time zones. The total number of students from all three offerings exceeded 70,000.
ECE 598HK, "Parallel Algorithm Techniques." Algorithm techniques for enhancing the scalability of parallel software:  scatter-to-gather, problem decomposition, binning, privatization, tiling, regularization, compaction, double-buffering, and data layout. These techniques address the most challenging problems in building scalable parallel software: limited parallelism, data contention, insufficient  memory bandwidth, load balance, and communication latency. (For Spring 2013).
ECE 408, "Applied Parallel Programming." Co-created the course with David Kirk, Chief Scientist and Fellow of NVIDIA. Developed lectures, lab material, final project workshops. The lecture recordings have been downloaded by thousands of students worldwide. A new book has been published: "Programming Massively Parallel Processors, A Hands-on Approach"  Morgan Kaufman Publisher, (ISBN 978-0-12-381472-2) - 2010.
