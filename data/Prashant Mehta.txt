Research StatementProfessor Prashant Mehta's research focus is broadly in two areas - (I) Controlled interacting particle systems where the emphasis is on developing particle-based algorithms for nonlinear estimation and mean-field optimal control. In particular, Mehta's research group at UIUC invented the feedback particle filter (FPF) algorithm for nonlinear estimation. (II) Application of such algorithms to machine learning problems. In Mehta's research group and at his startup, the FPF algorithm was applied to solve the human activity recognition (HAR) problem using real-time data from body-worn motion sensors (accelerometer and gyroscope).  Prior to joining Illinois, Professor Mehta worked at the United Technologies Research Center (UTRC) in the area of modeling and control of combustion instabilities in jet engines and afterburners.  The state-of-the-art in control of rotating wave combustion instabilities in jet engines and afterburners is based on a “symmetry breaking” solution that Professor Mehta invented together with his colleagues at UTRC.
