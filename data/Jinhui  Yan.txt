BiographyJinhui Yan started his independent research career as an assistant professor in CEE at Illinois since Fall 2018 after finishing a two-year postdoc at Northwestern Univesity. He got his Ph.D. from the University of California, San Diego. Jinhui is broadly working on computational mechanics, fluid-structure interaction, multi-phase flows and isogeometric analysis, and their applications to real-world engineering problems such as wind energy, tidal energy, and metallic additive manufacturing. He is a member of ASME, ASCE, and USACM and has been organizing many symposiums and workshops in these societies. He has won many academic awards, including ASME Robert M. and Mary Haythornthwaite Initiation Grant Award, Chinese Government Award for Outstanding Self-financed Students Abroad, Charles Lee Powell Fellowship, and the nomination for the UCSD Chancellor Dissertation Medal. He is always looking forward to working with self-motivated students on challenging research projects.

Research Interests
My group works on computational mechanics. One particular area is computational interface-coupled multi-physics, such as fluid-structure interaction, multi-phase flows, and their application to real-world engineering problems in renewable energy and additive manufacturing. For example, he and his group are working on developing computational free-surface fluid-structure interaction method to help understand the dynamic response of offshore floating wind turbines in ocean waves, and improve the survivability and efficiency of the turbine in harsh sea states. He is also working on high-fidelity multi-scale thermal fluid models to derive process-structure-property relationships in metallic additive manufacturing.
