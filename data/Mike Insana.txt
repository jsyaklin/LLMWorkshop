Research StatementLaboratory research focuses on the development of novel ultrasonic instrumentation and methods for imaging soft tissue microstructure, viscoelasticity and blood flow.  The goal is to understand basic mechanisms of cancerous lesion formation, metastatic progression, responses to therapy, and sources of image contrast.  Research includes the fundamentals of imaging system design and performance evaluation, signal processing, detection and estimation.  The lab uses polymer hydrogels to develop models of visco- and poroelastic behavior of soft tissues for cancer imaging.  Insana's lab also investigates spatio-temporal filtering for noise reduction and enhanced spatial resolution with applications in breast elasticity imaging and arterial-wall shear-stress estimation.
Graduate Research OpportunitiesI now supervise 2 graduate students.
