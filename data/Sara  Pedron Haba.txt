Research StatementWe have insufficient understanding of the complexity of the brain. Most in vitro systems do not recreate its biology and function. Moreover, the obstacles to studying the interactions between human genetics and environmental factors results in a gap of knowledge about the causes of brain diseases. Microphysiological systems seek to integrate different brain cells in a controlled three-dimensional environmental configuration to obtain platforms that better recreate brain physiology in a simple and affordable approach. These systems will enhance the efficacy and toxicological assessment for specific patients, enhancing treatment options and improving patient’s quality of life. There is an urgent clinical need for the development of physiologically relevant platforms that can mimic the brain. My research goal is to serve in the advancement of this technology to create biomaterial-based platforms that study disease development and therapeutic approaches. I focus on these areas: 1.	Recreate brain disease microenvironments. Construction of complex biomaterial platforms that address the required signals to control cell fate in multicellular platforms. 2.	Materials and chemistry. Responsive and dynamic biomaterials that mimic the properties of the cellular microenvironment, provide appropriate signaling and monitor cell response.3.	Therapeutics. Monitoring of mechanisms of tumor resistance and establishment of alternative therapeutic targets.
