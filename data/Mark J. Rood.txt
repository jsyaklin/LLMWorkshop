BiographyMark J. Rood received a B.S.E.S. from Illinois Institute of Technology and M.S. and Ph.D. degrees from University of Washington, all in Environmental Engineering. He is currently the Ivan Racheff Professor of Environmental Engineering, Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering, University of Illinois.
Dr. Rood has served as the Associate Editor for Journal of Air and Waste Management Association, as an Associate Editor of Journal of Environmental Engineering and as the Editor and Chief of Journal of Environmental Engineering. He was an Executive Board member and Treasurer of the Association of Environmental Engineering and Science Professors, and he received the Distinguished Recognition Award from that Association. He is also the recipient of the “Lyman A. Ripperton Environmental Educator Award” from the Air and Waste Management Association, “Best Research & Development Team Award” from DoD’s Energy Research and Development Center, and the “Outstanding Cooperator’s Award” from the Illinois State Geological Survey. Professor Rood was the Coordinator of the Environmental Engineering and Science Program at the U of I for six years. He is a member of the Environmental Engineering Committee of USEPA’s Science Advisory Board. He actively participates on panels for USEPA, NSF, and DOD. Dr. Rood was the President of the Board of the Community Recycling Center in Champaign-Urbana and member of Urbana Park District’s Advisory Committee in Illinois.
Professor Rood has taught on-campus and online environmental engineering courses including air-quality engineering courses at the undergraduate and graduate levels. He was recognized for his teaching abilities by inclusion in the “List of Teachers Ranked as Excellent by Their Students” four times and recognized for his commitment to advising by receiving the “College of Engineering Excellent Advisor Award” four times at UI. He has advised more than 20 Ph.D. and 40 M.S. graduate students resulting in more than 80 peer-reviewed journal publications, eight book chapters, more than 100 conference proceedings, two patents, and one ASTM International Standard Test Method. He has provided more than 30 national and international invited lectures. His advisees have been placed at academic institutions, EPA offices, and the private sector. Eleven of his Ph.D. advisees became professors in USA, Taiwan, Canada, China, and Turkey.

Research StatementProfessor Rood specializes in the use of physical and chemical principles to characterize the optical and chemical properties of ambient aerosols related to opacity, visibility, and climate change. These techniques use extractive-based and remote-based sampling techniques. He also pioneers the development of effective methods and materials to separate hazardous materials from gas streams and the separation and recovery of organic vapors/gases from gas streams for reuse in a sustainable manner.
Research Interests
Environmental Air Quality: aerosol chemistry and physics; ammonia emissions from agricultural fields; physical and chemical principles to separate and recover or destroy vapors and gases from gas streams in a sustainable manner
