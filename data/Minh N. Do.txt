Education
Doctor of Science in Communication Systems, Swiss Federal Institute of Technology Lausanne (EPFL), Switzerland, 2001.

BiographyMinh N. Do received the B.Eng. degree in Computer Engineering from the University of Canberra, Australia, in 1997, and the Dr.Sci. degree in Communication Systems from the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology Lausanne (EPFL) in 2001.  Since 2002, he has been on the faculty at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, where he is currently the Thomas and Margaret Huang Endowed Professor in Signal Processing & Data Science in the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, and holds affiliate appointments with the Coordinated Science Laboratory, the Beckman Institute for Advanced Science and Technology, the Department of Bioengineering, and the Department of Computer Science.  He received a Silver Medal from the 32nd International Mathematical Olympiad in 1991, University Medal from the University of Canberra in 1997, Doctorate Award from the EPFL in 2001, CAREER Award from the National Science Foundation in 2003,  Xerox Award for Faculty Research from UIUC in 2007, and Young Author Best Paper Award from IEEE in 2008.  He was an Associate Editor of the IEEE Transactions on Image Processing, and a member of several IEEE Technical Committees on Signal Processing.  He was elected as an IEEE Fellow in 2014 for his contributions to image representation and computational imaging.  He has contributed to several tech-transfer efforts, including as a co-founder and CTO of Personify and Chief Scientist of Misfit.  During 2020-2021 he served as the Vice-Provost, and then continues as Honorary Vice-Provost, for VinUniversity, the first private, not-for-profit Vietnamese university established based on international standards. He also serves as the Director of the joint VinUni-Illinois Smart Health Center.
