Teaching StatementMy teaching philosophy involves focusing on big ideas, applied engineering and using systems-thinking approaches to problem solving.  I like to introduce a little bit of theory behind topics, either the historical perspective or show derivations for relationships, and then show application.  I also use projects as a way for students to explore concepts and apply their knowledge.  For example, I teach our capstone design sequence where the students work on clinical and industry relevant projects and I also teach the Bioreactor Lab where students learn techniques and experimental design for tissue engineering careers.  This also compliments my role in the department to look at the curriculum as a large system and analyze overlap, map concepts through courses, and make sure that we are covering what needs to be covered.  We have a really unique curriculum and the faculty focus a lot of time and energy on constantly improving it.

Research StatementMy main research objective is to study applications of research-based pedagogy in the classroom and across a curriculum as well as design of assessment strategies for measuring student learning. Most of my educational research is at the program level, focusing on changes in faculty development and training needed to support new pedagogy as well as tracking student performance and development across the curriculum. I also have a passion for bringing professional skills (communication, ethics, historical perspectives, intercultural competency, and life-long learning) into the forefront of engineering education. My work spans K-12 outreach, undergraduate, graduate, and professional education settings. 
Graduate Research OpportunitiesMy lab is always looking for outstanding candidates with an interest in education and skills in computing, statistics, modeling, and creating visual representations of data. Lab members will work in a multidisciplinary team to solve problems in engineering and medical education.
