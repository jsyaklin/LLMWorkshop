BiographyXu Chen received his Ph.D. from ECE ILLINOIS in 2018. Prior to graduate school, he had been a hardware engineer at IBM Systems Group (2005-2012) and Apple. He has many years of industry experience in electromagnetics modeling and simulation for signal and power integrity analysis. Currently, his research focus is on stochastic modeling for electromagnetics and circuits, and using machine learning to create faster and smarter tools for microelectronic circuits and systems design. He is a member of Center for Advanced Electronics Through Machine Learning (CAEML) IUCRC. He is also a member of the Technical Program Committee of IEEE Conference on Electrical Performance of Electronic Packaging and Systems (EPEPS). He has taught several courses at ECE ILLINOIS including ECE 210, ECE 313, ECE 329, ECE 342, ECE 447, and ECE 457.
