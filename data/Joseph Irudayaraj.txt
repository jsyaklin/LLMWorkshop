BiographyDr. Irudayaraj has a background in biological engineering and computer sciences. The basis for his work stems from a multidisciplinary background and skills developed in the fields of engineering, biosciences, and computer sciences. He is the Founder Professor of Bioengineering at UIUC. Prior to UIUC, he has held faculty positions at Purdue University, The Pennsylvania State University, and Utah State University. His group has extensively published in biosensors, single cell dynamics,  and nanotechnology applied to human health and biosecurity. They are interested in developing smart therapeutics - drug delivery for hypoxia and immunotherapy, single cell analysis of epigenetic regulation, epigenetic regulation and PFAS toxicology to understand cellular processes and disease mechanisms for cancer.
