BiographyI am the  W.J. ‘Jerry’ Sanders III – Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. Endowed Chair Professor at the University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign and a fellow of ACM, IEEE, and NAI. From 2018 to 2020, I took a leave of absence and as a Sr. Vice President at a major memory manufacturing company I led the development of next-generation DRAM products, including the industry's first HBM-PIM that will play a significant role in shaping the future computing landscape. Prior to joining the University of Illinois in the fall of 2015, I was an associate professor at the University of Wisconsin, Madison where I was early-tenured in 2013. My interdisciplinary research incorporates device, circuit, architecture, and software for power-efficient computing. Prior to joining the University of Wisconsin, Madison, I was a senior research scientist at Intel from 2004 to 2008, where I conducted research in power-efficient digital circuit and process architecture. I have published more than 250 refereed articles to highly-selective conferences and journals in the field of digital circuit, processor architecture, and computer-aided design. The top three most frequently cited papers have more than 5000 citations and  the total number of citations of all my papers exceeds 15000. I was a recipient of the IEEE Design Automation Conference (DAC) Student Design Contest Award in 2001, Intel Fellowship in 2002, the IEEE International Symposium on Microarchitecture (MICRO) Best Paper Award in 2003, NSF CAREER Award in 2010, IBM Faculty Award in 2011 and 2012, the University of Wisconsin Villas Associates Award in 2015, ACM/IEEE Most Influential International Symposium on Computer Architecture (ISCA) Paper Award in 2017, and SIGMICRO 2021 Test of Time Awards in 2021. I am a hall of fame member of all three major computer architecture conferences, IEEE International Symposium on High-Performance Computer Architecture (HPCA) , MICRO, and ISCA. I earned a PhD degree in Computer Science and Engineering from the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor and Master and Bachelor degrees in Electrical Engineering from the Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology.
