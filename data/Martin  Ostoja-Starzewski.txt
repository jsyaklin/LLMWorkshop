BiographyMartin Ostoja-Starzewski is a Professor of Mechanical Science and Engineering, with an affiliate appointment at Beckman Institute. His research interests are primarily in (thermo)mechanics and transport phenomena in random and fractal media, advanced continuum theories, and stochastic wave propagation.  His work established quantitative estimates of the size of representative volume element (RVE) of continuum models for many linear and nonlinear (in)elastic materials.  On this basis, Martin has played a central role in introducing a statistical volume element (SVE) to formulate micromechanics-based, tensor random field models for stochastic PDEs and finite elements. In recent years, Martin has (i) led mechanics of fractal materials, and (ii) pioneered continuum physics with spontaneous violations of the second law of thermodynamics.  He wrote 225+ journal papers, including 20+ in Proceedings/Philosophical Transactions of Royal Society, London A; 10+ in PRB, PRE, and PRL. Martin also wrote four books: 1. Microstructural Randomness and Scaling in Mechanics of Materials, CRC Press (2007); 2. Thermoelasticity with Finite Wave Speeds (with J. Ignaczak), Oxford Mathematical Monographs (2009); 3. Tensor-Valued Random Fields for Continuum Physics (with A. Malyarenko), Cambridge Monographs on Mathematical Physics (2019); 4. Random Fields of Piezoelectricity and Piezomagnetism (with A. Malyarenko and A. Amiri-Hezaveh), SpringerBriefs (2020). Martin is very active in the editorial sphere having (co-)edited 16 books/journal special issues and co-organized various meetings.  Also, Editor of Acta Mechanica (2017-2024), Chair Managing Editor of Mathematics and Mechanics of Complex Systems (MEMOCS, 2012-2023), Editor-in-Chief of Journal of Thermal Stresses (2017-); Assoc. Editor of Mechanics Research Communications (2015-) and ASME Journal of Applied Mechanics (2006-2012); co-Editor of CRC Modern Mechanics and Mathematics Series (2012-).  He is on the editorial boards of 10+ other journals.  He is a Fellow of ASME, AAM (American Academy of Mechanics), WIF (World Innovation Foundation), SES, and Associate Fellow of AIAA.  He was on the Executive Committee of The International Society for the Interaction of Mechanics and Mathematics (ISIMM), 2013-2016. Worcester Reed Warner Medal of ASME (2018).  Rothschild Distinguished Visiting Fellow at the Isaac Newton Institute for Mathematical Sciences, University of Cambridge (2023).  European Academy of Sciences and Arts, Member (2022).  Academia Europaea, Foreign Member (2024).
