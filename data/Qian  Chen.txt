Professional Highlights
Prof. Qian Chen is currently an Associate Professor and Racheff Scholar in the Materials Science and Engineering Department at University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign (UIUC). She obtained her PhD from the same department with Prof. Steve Granick (2012) and did her postdoc with Prof. Paul Alivisatos at UC Berkeley under Miller Fellowship. She joined the faculty of UIUC in 2015 and since then has received awards for the research in her group including Victor LaMer award in ACS (2015), Forbes 30 under 30 Science List (2016), Air Force Office of Scientific Research YIP award (2017), National Science Foundation CAREER award (2018), Sloan Research Fellow in Chemistry (2018), Unilever award in ACS (2018), Dean’s Award for Excellence in Research (2020&2022), and the Hanwha-TotalEnergies IUPAC Young Scientist Award (2022). The research in her group focuses on the broad scheme of imaging, understanding and engineering soft materials at the nanoscale, including systems such as colloidal self-assembly, protein transformation, advanced battery devices, metamaterials, and energy-efficient separation strategies."
