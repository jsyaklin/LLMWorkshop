BiographyJonathan J.L. Higdon is the Dennis and Cathy Houston Professor in Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering. An award winning teacher and scholar, Dr. Higdon is a leader in the field of fluid mechanics. His research interests include computational fluid dynamics, the mechanics of complex fluids, geophysical fluid dynamics, and petroleum reservoir simulation. Dr. Higdon joined the department in 1980. He received his BES and MSE from The Johns Hopkins University and his PhD in Applied Mathematics and Theoretical Physics from Cambridge University, where he was a Winston Churchill Scholar and a National Science Foundation Fellow. He completed his postdoctoral studies at Stanford University.
