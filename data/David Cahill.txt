Professional Highlights
David Cahill is the Grainger Distinguished Chair in Engineering and Professor of Materials Science and Engineering at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign. He joined the faculty of the Department of Materials Science and Engineering at the U. Illinois after earning his Ph.D. in condensed matter physics from Cornell University and working as a postdoctoral research associate at the IBM Watson Research Center. He served as department head from 2010 to 2018. His research program advances physical insights on thermal transport at the nanoscale; extremes of low and high thermal conductivity; the thermal conductivity of soft matter; the thermal science of magnetic materials; and the transport of heat and mass in battery materials. Cahill received the 2018 Innovation in Materials Characterization Award of the Materials Research Society, the 2015 Touloukian Award of the American Society of Mechanical Engineers, the 2023 Klemens Award from the International Conference on Phonon Scattering in Condensed Matter, and the 2024 Thermal Conductivity Award from the International Thermal Conductivity Conference; and is a fellow of the MRS, the American Physical Society, the AAAS, and was elected a member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 2023.


Research StatementThermal management is a critical  issue in a wide variety of  applications of thin films materials from  state-of-the-art  microprocessors to turbine engines. Heat can be carried by any   excitation of the solid that is thermally excited: lattice vibrations,  electrons,  spin-waves. The lifetime or coherence of these excitations  have a complex  dependence the microstructure of materials; at nanometer  length scales, the  transfer of heat between various excitations at  interfaces becomes the  controlling factor. Our group studies the basic  science of thermal transport in  materials with a particular emphasis on  the exchange of thermal energy at  solid-solid and solid-liquid  interfaces. We have recently developed new and  powerful methods of  characterizing nanoscale thermal transport using ultrafast  laser  metrology of precisely controlled thin film multilayers and suspensions   of metallic nanoparticles.  We are currently working to extend our   experimental methods to higher resolution in time, space, and energy.
